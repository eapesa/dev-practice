**SOME NOTES**
1.	Please ensure that you install the prerequisites listed below.
2.	Everything that we’ll do in TEDTalk needs not be memorized. It’s purpose is to serve as guide or template to our future developments. Do not get pressured in memorizing code syntaxes or git commands; it’s the logic and practice that counts. There’s always Google and specifically, StackOverflow, for the syntaxes and commands.
